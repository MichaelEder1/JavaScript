# Currency Converter

This currency converter converts a variable amount form one currency into an other. For support it offers autocompletion of the desired currency while typing. For this, I used the [Currency Converter API](https://www.currencyconverterapi.com/).

Input an amount, an source-currency and the dsesired currency.
